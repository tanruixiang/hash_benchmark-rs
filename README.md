# Hash Benchmark

## How to run
```bash
make run
```

Result:

```
key num is 100000, len of each key:100
----Build_cost(ns)------
default:3419706, ahash:1491889, murmur:9708750, murmur2:7616865, seahash:5159682, seahash2:3010833
----Std_dev------
default:28.798, ahash:29.930, murmur:27.729, murmur2:27.729, seahash:29.800, seahash2:27.518

```

## Conclusion

- ahash is fastest, and hash code generated by it is most evenly distributed.
