# Hash Benchmark

## How to run
```bash
make run
```

Result:

```
key num is 10000, len of each key:100
build_cost:(ns)
default:417554, ahash:214978, murmur:969171, seahash:432687, seahash2:273801
std_dev
default:20.845, ahash:25.226, murmur:26.327, seahash:20.184, seahash2:25.717
```

## Conclusion

- ahash is fastest, and hash code generated by it is most evenly distributed.
